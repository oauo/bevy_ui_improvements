# Bevy UI Stuff

## In this repo

- Rem and Em units
- Val::Calc()
- StyleBuilder - for making easily editable and shareable styles that affect both Style and other properties such as background_color.
- Button tweaks - component to determine if an action was a real click (down and up on the element) and reduces boilerplate, and component to easily control cursor.

## Other things

Not in this repo

- Container queries - a way to apply styles that fit size criteria for viewport and container. Just not sure how it should look.
